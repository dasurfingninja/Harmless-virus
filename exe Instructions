# When trying to run the exe file, windows blocks it with their firewall.
### To fix this you have to stop windows firewall, so DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. 
### If you do decide to, make sure you START UP WINDOWS FIREWALL AGAIN after you are done.
###If not you are easily able to be hacked.
### To stop windows firewall, go to the control panel, go to system and security, and then to Windows Defender Firewall
### Then there you should see a way to disable the firewall, and my exe file should work.
