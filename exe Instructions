<h2> When trying to run the exe file, you may run into some problems because the windows defender smartscreen blocks it.
<h3> To fix this, you need to lower security settings on your computer, which can be dangerous.'
<h3> I would tell  you all the steps, but just look up "how to disable windows defender smartscreen" on google to save me some time.
<h3> an easier way you can also do this is go to the exe file, right click on it, click properties, click unblock, click apply, click ok.
this will unblock the .exe file but if it still doesnt work, you may have to manually make the .py file that is also in 
this repository a .exe file, which is long and complicated, but there are some good youtube videos and wikihow tutorials 
on how to do it.</h3>
